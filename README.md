# mongodb-builder
Vagrant box builders for mongodb

**Note:** None of the boxes come up automatically on a `vagrant up` to avoid tons of machines getting instantiated at the same time.

# Centos-72 (centos72)
Box can build up to v3.2 at the moment.  v3.4 requires gcc/g++ > 5.3.

# Ubuntu-14.04 (trusty)
Box can build up to v3.4
